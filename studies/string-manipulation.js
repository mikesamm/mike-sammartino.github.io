/**
 * STRING MANIPULATION
 * 
 * Strings are array-like. Strings are immutable, but reassignable. 
 * We can interact with them with operators and string methods like .slice() and .join().
 * Strings are iterable, although it may be useful to split a string into an array to then use array methods. 
 * 
 * 1. With Operators
 * 
 * 2. With String Methods

/* With Operators

+, +=, more? is there a reason for more? 
comparison operators
*/

/* With String Methods

| Method         | Action                     
| -------------- | -------------------------- 
| .includes()    | returns true or false if argument is found in string
| .replaceAll()  | replaces all instances of a character or regular expression
| .slice()       | returns a new string, a substring from specified index range of original string         
| .split()       | returns an array populated with chars from a string, takes in a string to determine where it separates original string
| .toLowerCase() | returns new string, an all lowercase version of the original
