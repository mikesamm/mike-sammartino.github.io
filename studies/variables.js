/**
 * VARIABLES:
 * 
 * 0. Variables hold values so that a programmer can refer to, interact with, and reuse those values throughout a program. CHANGE: The values can be simple or complex data types, like numbers, strings, booleans, and objects and arrays. Values held by variables can change while the variable name stays the same. JavaScript is not a strictly written language, there is no need to declare the data type of the value assigned to the variable.
